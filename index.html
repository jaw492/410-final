        <h2>Prototypes</h2>

        <h3>Lo-Fi Prototypes</h3>
        <div class="gallery">
            <img src="./sources/images/lowfi1.png" alt="Lo-fi sketch 1">
            <img src="./sources/images/lowfi2.png" alt="Lo-fi sketch 2">
            <img src="./sources/images/lowfi3.png" alt="Lo-fi sketch 3">
        </div>
        <p>These Lo-Fi prototypes outline the foundation of Learn Live. An intro screen, lecture dashboard, and an
            interactive lecture screen can be seen in one of the prototypes. These features were the beginning of our
            project.</p>

        <h3>Hi-Fi Prototypes</h3>
        <div class="gallery">
            <img src="./sources/images/hifi1.png" alt="Hi-fi prototype 1">
            <img src="./sources/images/hifi3.png" alt="Hi-fi prototype 2">

                target="_blank">Open Figma Prototype</a></p>

        <p>These Hi-Fi prototypes shows the foundation for our app’s UI design. It shows the features we originally
            wanted for our app.</p>

    <!-- Evaluation -->
    <section id="evaluation">
        <h2>Evaluation Summary</h2>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong>
            Our evaluation process consisted of a combination of user-testing with both AI and real world participants.
            Our methods of gathering feedback on usability testing were by using the USE and SUS scores to evaluate
            usability, efficiency, and effectiveness. Both AI and human participants were given the same tasks to
            complete for their respective scoring: log-in, go to the AI chat, navigate to the the quiz section, complete
            the quiz (regardless of correct or incorrect answer). So, we gave the human participants a time-to-complete
            of around 5-10 minutes to complete the task they were given. Once the task was completed, the participants
            would then fill out their USE score or SUS score sheets to report their feedback to us.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Design Changes Made Based on Results:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Changes to the main page where the student interacts with LearnLive</li>
            <li>Sidebar with checkpoints to track activity and doesn’t allow progression to games until reached</li>
            <li>Notice the quick access to knowledge check(quiz button, Scavenger) This encourages the student to do
                more activity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Result Summary</h2>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong>
            The main design changes were regarding ease of use and ease of learning, with one of the biggest comments
            being that the buttons were small and in a weird orientation. So, one of the big changes we made was making
            the buttons larger and in a more intuitive area for the user to quickly cycle through where they wanted to
            go within the app. Another concern was the lack of interactive learning features and the heavy reliance on
            AI instead of making a better, more fun way to achieve their studying goals. With that feedback, we decided
            to implement a more interactive quizzing experience with more questions to test user knowledge, as well as
            adding a new mode called scavenger mode where users test their knowledge by matching answers with their
            relevant topics they learned, which greatly improved our user satisfaction regarding interactive learning
            features.
